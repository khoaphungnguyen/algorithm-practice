# Daily Coding Topics

This project is designed to help you practice different coding topics each day. The topics include Depth-First Search on Trees, Binary Search Trees, Backtracking and more. Each topic has a set of related problems to solve.

## How to Use

Run the `main` function to start the program. You will be prompted to select a topic and then choose a specific problem to solve.

### Topics and Concepts

#### Day 1: Depth-First Search on Trees

**Concepts:**

1. Check if a tree is balanced
2. Deserialize and serialize a tree
3. Invert a binary tree

#### Day 2: Binary Search Tree

**Concepts:**

1. Check if the tree is a valid BST
2. Insert a node into a BST correctly
3. Find the Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree
4. Find the Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree

#### Day 3: Backtracking

**Concepts:**

1. Find all the root-to-leaf paths of a ternary tree
2. Find a list of strings in lexicographical order
3. Find all possible letter combinations of a phone number
4. Partition a string into palindromes
5. Generate all valid parentheses
6. Generate all permutations

#### Sample Commands

```shell
go run main.go
```

When prompted, enter `3` to select Backtracking. Then choose the specific problem you want to solve.

### Additional Notes

- Ensure your Go environment is set up correctly.
- Each day's topic and problem set is implemented in separate packages (`day1dfsontree`, `day2bst`, `day3backtracking`).

Feel free to explore and practice each topic. Happy coding!
